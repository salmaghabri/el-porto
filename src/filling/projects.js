      "Method 1 involves generating detection files with YOLOv9 and feeding them into AlphaPose for subsequent pose estimation.",

    description: [
      "During my fourth year as a software engineering student, I worked on an end-of-year project to enhance a deep learning model for detecting changes in multispectral satellite images over time. The project spanned the entire second semester, and we built upon the foundational work of the reference paper 'A Deep Learning Model for Change Detection on Satellite Images' As part of this project, we conducted a comprehensive literature review on remote sensing indices and semantic segmentation in satellite imagery. By leveraging remote sensing indices for feature engineering and band selection, along with  and dimensionality reduction techniques, we improved the model’s F1 score and global accuracy",
      " This marked my first exploration into the interesting intersection of remote sensing and machine learning",

The CSV file represented both the data at rest and the stream of incoming data. For batch processing, we computed the average temperature for each capital, while the streaming component extracted the maximum average temperature in real-time for each capital. The data was stored in a NoSQL database and later visualized in real-time through a web application.",

We started by scraping data from various second-hand car sales websites. The core part of this project was data cleaning and preprocessing, which is crucial the next steps. We then conducted an in-depth data analysis and visualization to identify market trends. Next, we trained and evaluated a machine learning model to predict car prices based on the cleaned data. We finally wrapped everything in PyQt app to allow users to input car attributes and receive price predictions, making the model usable in real-world scenarios.",
